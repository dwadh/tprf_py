Python implementation of the Three Pass Regression Filter introduced in the paper by Bryan Kelly and Seth Pruitt:
Kelly, B., and Pruitt S.. 2015. The three-pass regression filter: A new approach to forecasting using many predictors. Journal of Econometrics 186:294â€“316.

This code replicates the simulation results but can be modified to work with other datasets. The implementation is based on my understanding of the paper, open to comments and suggestions.
